# ng2-adal

`master` branch of this repo is now Angular 4+ compatible. Thanks to @Cyberdada.
For Angular2, I have created a separate `Angular 2` branch. NPM package starting from version 2.0 is for Angular 4. Packages 1.x are for Angular 2.

**BREAKING CHANGE**: Make sure you're importing AdalService like this: `import { AdalService } from "ng2-adal/dist/core"`

**Note**: NPM package 1.02 is also Angular 4 and was published by mistake, you can ignore that one


To do authentication against Microsoft Windows Azure AD, using the Microsoft ADAL library underneath. Note this library is extracted from the <b>adal-angular</b> package.
